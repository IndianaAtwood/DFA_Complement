The DFA.json file represents a DFA that accepts strings with 
substring "aba". The output will reject these same strings.

FOR COMPILATION:
	gcc -g *.c -o complement

FOR RUNNING:
	./complement

	Then, type the name of the file. Ex: DFA.json

FOR OUTPUT:
	cat newDFA.json

If there is an error in the formatting of the DFA.json file, it will
print an error message to the terminal.
